# Boyd Kane's personal website

See the website at [beyarkay.github.io](https://beyarkay.github.io).

## Current Status

Currently the website is just a front-end for
[eskom-calend](https://github.com/beyarkay/eskom-calendar/releases/tag/latest),
but long term it will become my personal CV and a record of past projects.


## `eskom-calendar`

eskom-calendar allows users to add Eskom loadshedding to their digital
calendar. You can simply subscribe to the correct internet calendar and then
you'll see your loadshedding schedules for the rest of time. It's advert-free,
up-to-date, and open-source.
